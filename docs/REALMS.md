## Linking GitHub and Realms

After creating your Realms proposal:

2. Update the frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   on_chain_proposal: https://realms.today/dao/[DAO_ID]/proposal/[PROPOSAL_ID]
   status: voting
   ```
3. Comment on the PR with the Realms link
4. Notify council members in Discord

## Voting on Proposals

### For Council Members

1. Review proposal details on both GitHub and Realms
2. Visit the Realms proposal page
3. Connect your council wallet
4. Cast vote: **Yes**, **No**, or **Abstain**
5. Add optional comment explaining your vote

### Voting Best Practices

- Review GitHub discussion before voting
- Verify budget calculations
- Check proposer's contribution history
- Consider proposal's impact on community

## After Voting Completes

### If Approved

1. Proposal enters **"Succeeded"** state
2. Anyone can execute (pay gas to finalize)
3. Treasury transfers happen automatically
4. Update GitHub proposal:
   ```yaml
   status: executed
   ```

### If Rejected

1. Proposal marked **"Defeated"**
2. Proposer can revise and resubmit
3. Update GitHub proposal:
   ```yaml
   status: rejected
   ```

## Multi-Sig Operations

For approved treasury proposals:
- Execution requires multi-sig approval
- Current signers: [TBD]
- Threshold: [X] of [Y] signers
- Typical execution time: 24-48 hours

## Common Issues

### "Not a Council Member"
- Verify your wallet holds the council token
- Check you're connected with the correct wallet
- Contact DAO administrators if status incorrect

### "Insufficient Voting Power"
- Council tokens are non-transferable
- Each member has exactly 1 vote
- Cannot delegate or accumulate votes

### Transaction Failures
- Ensure sufficient SOL for fees (~0.01 SOL)
- Try again during lower network congestion
- Check wallet connectivity

## Emergency Procedures

For urgent treasury actions:
1. Create **Emergency** proposal type
2. 24-hour voting period
3. 20% quorum requirement
4. Requires follow-up documentation
