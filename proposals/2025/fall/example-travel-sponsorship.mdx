# Summary

Example University Blockchain Club requests $15,000 to sponsor travel for 30 students from 10 different College DAO member clubs to attend a major blockchain conference. This program will provide opportunities for students to network, learn from industry leaders, and showcase their projects on a global stage.

## Motivation & Impact

### Why This Matters
- **Access**: Many talented students can't afford international conference travel
- **Networking**: Direct connections with protocol teams and potential employers
- **Learning**: Exposure to cutting-edge research and development
- **Representation**: Showcasing university blockchain innovation globally

### Expected Outcomes
- 30 students gain international conference experience
- 10+ student projects presented at side events
- 50+ new industry connections per student
- 5+ potential job/internship opportunities
- Strengthened College DAO presence in global ecosystem
