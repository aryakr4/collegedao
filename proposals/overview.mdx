# Proposals Overview

Welcome to the College DAO proposals section. Here you can explore funding proposals submitted by university blockchain clubs and organizations seeking support for their initiatives.

## Proposal Structure

Proposals are organized by:
- **Year**: The calendar year when the proposal was submitted
- **Season**: Spring (Jan-Mar), Summer (Apr-Jun), Fall (Jul-Sep), or Winter (Oct-Dec)
- **Type**: Travel sponsorship, hackathon support, educational events, infrastructure, etc.

## Proposal Process

1. **Draft on GitHub**: Create your proposal as a markdown file in the appropriate year/season folder
2. **Community Review**: The community provides feedback through PR comments
3. **On-chain Proposal**: Once refined, create a linked Realms proposal for voting
4. **Council Vote**: DAO council members vote on the proposal
5. **Execution**: Approved proposals receive funding from the treasury

## Proposal Requirements

Each proposal must include:
- Clear objectives and expected outcomes
